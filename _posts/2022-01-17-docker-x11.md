# 0. Introduction
Sometimes it could be useful to run some multimedia applications inside a container. Personally, I stick with LXC and there are plenty of information about how to pass-through X11, PulseAudio and even Nvidia GPU in the Net. However, there are a few information about how to do that in a Docker container. This small post is merely a reminder for myself but also I hope that it could be useful for someone else. For a ready to use solution one can refer to [this GitHub repo][gh-repo]. 

# 1. A bit of theory

## 1.0 PulseAudio
According to the [pulseaudio(1)][pulseaudio], the PulseAudio client libraries check for a set of environment variables, such as `$PULSE_SOURCE`, `$PULSE_SERVER`, etc, and these environment variables change the behaviour of the clients. One particular environment variable is interested to us, this is `$PULSE_SERVER`. The variable contains a string which denotes a list of server addresses, where each entry is separated by a whitespace, which are tried in turn. A server address may contain a prefix with an optional address type specifier, such as `unix:`, `tcp:`, etc. For more information please refer to `pulseaudio(1)`. If PulseAudio is running per-user, as in my case, then we can bind-mount the PulseAudio AF_UNIX socket file inside our Docker container. The only issue here is that we need the same UID/GID in the Docker container as in the host system to meet access control rules. After that we can set, in the `~/.bashrc` e.g, and use `$PULSE_SERVER` inside the Docker container, or create a `~/.config/pulse/client.conf` configuration file, it is a matter of choice.

## 1.1 X11
Xorg supports different connection types: TCP, UNIX-domain socket, etc. In this post we will stick with UNIX-domain socket as it is the most common case. Basically, we need to bind-mount the socket into the Docker container. [Xserver(1)][xserver] states that the UNIX-domain socket file for the `$DISPLAY :0` can be found in `/tmp/.X11-unix/X0`. X11 has [its own][xsecurity] display access control. For UNIX-domain socket we can use `MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1`. When a client is using this method it sends a 128-bit "cookie" during connection establishment. The client's copy of the cookie is stored in `~/.Xauthority` file. We can use the same cookie, as in the host, in the Docker container. To register the cookie we will use [xauth(1)][xauth] utility.

## 1.2 GPU
For Intel it is quite straightforward to pass-through a GPU into the Docker container. As far as I understand the essential part which should be exposed to the container is [Direct Rendering Manager (DRM)][drm]. To do that we need to simply bind-mount `/dev/dri` into the container.

**WARNING:** one should remember about security implications as part of the host system is exposed to the container.

# 2. A bit of practice
Let's start by creating the Docker file. For example, here I will use Arch btw Linux as an example:

{% highlight dockerfile linenos %}
FROM archlinux AS x11-test

# Install necessary packages
RUN pacman -Sy
RUN pacman -S --noconfirm xorg-xauth firefox pulseaudio
# Create a group and a user with the same UID/GID as in the host for
# PulseAudio to ease its setup. For example UID=1000, GID=1001
RUN groupadd -g 1001 foobar
RUN useradd -m -u 1000 -g foobar -G audio,video,lp,users foobar
# Define environment variables for X11 and PulseAudio
ENV DISPLAY=:0
ENV PULSE_SERVER=unix:/tmp/pulse/native
# Define an argument. This needs to be passed in --build-arg
ARG cookie
# Switch to the user and make necessary directories
USER 1000:1001
RUN mkdir /tmp/.X11-unix
RUN mkdir /tmp/pulse
# Entry script
RUN : > ~/run.sh
RUN chmod +x ~/run.sh
RUN echo "#!/bin/sh" >> ~/run.sh
RUN echo "xauth add :0 MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 $cookie" >> ~/run.sh
RUN echo "firefox" >> ~/run.sh
# Run entry script
CMD ~/run.sh
{% endhighlight%}

The next step is to run the container. We will write a script for that:

{% highlight sh linenos %}
#!/bin/sh
docker run -it -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix \
               -v /run/user/1000/pulse/native:/tmp/pulse/native \
               -v /dev/dri:/dev/dri \
               x11-test
{% endhighlight%}
